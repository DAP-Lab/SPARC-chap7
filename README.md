#### Supplementary material for chapter 7 of SPARC monograph - "Indian Art Music: A Computational Perspective"
Contents:
* audios: audio files corresponding to the 8 examples in the chapter
  * audios for each example consist of the original mixture of vocal and pakhawaj ('mix.wav'), and the algorithmically source-separated vocals ('voc.wav') and pakhawaj ('pakh.wav')  

* annotations: annotation files for each of the examples
  * most examples contain a 'cycle.csv' with the 'sam' (cycle boundary) markings and a 'metadata.json' file with information such as the start and end times of the original concert that the example snippet is taken from, the notes used by the singer in the raga of the performance and their frequencies, etc. (such information can be used to annotate plots as in the book).
  * For some examples, there are additional annotation files for the syllables uttered by the vocalist ('syllables.csv'), the pakhawaj bols ('bols.csv'), metric tempo in each cycle ('mt.csv') and the surface tempo multiple or lay ratio in each cycle ('stm.csv').
